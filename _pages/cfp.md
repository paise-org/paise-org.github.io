All papers must be original.
The papers submitted to the workshop will be peer reviewed by a minimum of 3 reviewers.

The following paper categories are welcome:
* **Full Papers:** Full research papers should describe original work and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference, and be 7-8 pages in length. The full papers will be presented as 20 min talks.
* **Short Papers:** Position papers, visions, concepts, demo descriptions, or practice reports, 2 pages in length, should contain enough information for the program committee to evaluate whether the submission will generate discussion at the Workshop. Recently published work that is relevant to the Workshop is also welcome, although those submissions will not be included in the proceedings. The short papers will be presented as 5 min talks to seed the discussions following them.

Accepted papers will be included in the IPDPS workshop proceedings. With the objective of building the community, the organizers will facilitate piecing together a position paper reflecting the workshop discussions, co-authored by the participants and published at a suitable venue after the workshop. For more details on paper submission instructions, please visit the workshop webpage (https://paise.org).
