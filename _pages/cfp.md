* **Full Papers:** Full research papers should describe original work and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference, and be 8 pages in length (including all figures, tables and references). The full papers will be presented as 20 min talks, followed by Q&A.
* **Short Papers:** Research papers, positions, visions, concepts, demo descriptions, or practice reports, 4 pages in length  (including all figures, tables and references), should contain enough information for the program committee to evaluate whether the submission will generate discussion at the workshop.
