Edge computing is revolutionizing the computing landscape, from applications to hardware platforms. Building on the success of previous years and incorporating valuable feedback from in-person attendees at the 2023, 2024, and 2025 workshops, PAISE 2026 will feature a carefully balanced mix of interactive sessions and traditional technical talks. The goal is to foster organic discussions that complement traditional paper presentations, offering a much-needed platform to explore current trends, share visions, exchange feedback, and discuss solutions in the following key areas of edge computing:  

* applications — computer vision, machine learning, analytics, IoT;
* data flows — processing pipeline of data from ingestion to archival, pipeline of AI from learning to inference;
* control flows — parallel and distributed programming models and runtimes for managing constrained resources, cybersecurity; and
* infrastructure — storage, compute, and connectivity conducive to resource-constrained and harsh edge environments.

### Submission Types

All submitted papers must be original and will undergo a rigorous peer review process, evaluated by at least three independent reviewers. The following paper categories are welcome:

* **Full Papers:** Full research papers should present original work that has not been submitted simultaneously to another journal or conference. Submissions must be limited to 8 pages, including all figures, tables and references. Accepted papers will be allocated 20 min presentation slots, followed by 5 min for discussions and questions. 


* **Short Papers:** Submissions may include research papers, position papers, vision papers, conceptual ideas, demo descriptions, or practice reports. These should be limited to 4 pages, including all figures, tables and references, and must provide sufficient detail for the program committee to assess their potential to spark discussions at the workshop. Accepted papers will be allocated 15 min presentation slots, followed by 5 min for discussions and questions. 

Accepted papers will be published in the IPDPS workshop proceedings. Authors are also encouraged, though not required, to prepare and display posters complementing their talks throughout the workshop, providing workshop participants with the opportunity to engage with their work in a dynamic and flexible format.


### Topics (Tentative)

The following research topics are welcome:

* AI and IoT Applications at the Edge
* Digital Twins and Other Applications Catalyzed by Edge-Computing
* Collaborative and Distributed Learning at the Edge
* Edge-driven HPC, and HPC-steered Edge Computing
* Cyber-Security and Privacy in Edge Computing
* DevOps across Edge and Cloud
* Data and AI Lifecycle Management across Edge and Cloud
* Serverless and Other Programming Models for Edge
* Multitenancy at the Edge
* Energy Efficient and Low-Power Hardware and Software Architectures and Services for the Edge
* Sustainable and Green Edge AI

### Submission Instructions

Please upload your submission in the official IPDPS [Linklings portal submission](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ipdps/) server in PDF format. The submissions are single-blind, but double-blind submissions are also accepted.

Accepted manuscripts will be included in the IPDPS workshop proceedings. Templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
