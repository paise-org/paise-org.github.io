Edge computing is revolutionizing the computing landscape, from applications to hardware platforms. Building on the success of previous years and incorporating valuable feedback from in-person attendees at the 2023, 2024 and 2025 workshops, PAISE 2026 will feature a carefully balanced mix of interactive sessions and traditional technical talks. The goal is to foster organic discussions that complement traditional paper presentations, offering a much-needed platform to explore current trends, share visions, exchange feedback, and discuss solutions in the following key areas of edge computing:  

  * applications — computer vision, machine learning, analytics, IoT;
  * data flows — processing pipeline of data from ingestion to archival, pipeline of AI from learning to inference;
  * control flows — parallel and distributed programming models and runtimes for managing constrained resources, cybersecurity; and
  * infrastructure — storage, compute, and connectivity conducive to resource-constrained and harsh edge environments.
