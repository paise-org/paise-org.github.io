Edge computing is revolutionizing the computing landscape, from applications to hardware platforms. Building on the success of previous years and incorporating valuable feedback from in-person attendees at the 2023, 2024 and 2025 workshops, PAISE 2026 will feature a carefully balanced mix of interactive sessions and traditional technical talks. The goal is to foster organic discussions that complement traditional paper presentations, offering a much-needed platform to explore current trends, share visions, exchange feedback, and discuss solutions in the following key areas of edge computing:  

  * applications — computer vision, machine learning, analytics, IoT;
  * data flows — processing pipeline of data from ingestion to archival, pipeline of AI from learning to inference;
  * control flows — parallel and distributed programming models and runtimes for managing constrained resources, cybersecurity; and
  * infrastructure — storage, compute, and connectivity conducive to resource-constrained and harsh edge environments.

### Submission Types

All submitted papers must be original and will undergo a rigorous peer review process, evaluated by three independent reviewers. The following paper categories are welcome:

**Full Papers:** Full research papers should present original work that has not been submitted simultaneously to another journal or conference. Submissions must be limited to 8 pages, including all figures, tables and references. Accepted papers will be allocated 20 minutes for presentation, followed by 5 min for discussions. 

**Short Papers:** Submissions may include research papers, position papers, vision papers, conceptual ideas, demo descriptions, or practice reports. These should be limited to 4 pages, including all figures, tables and references, and must provide sufficient detail for the program committee to assess their potential to spark discussions at the workshop. Accepted papers will be allocated 15 minutes for presentation, followed by 5 min for discussions. 

Accepted papers will be published in the IPDPS workshop proceedings. Authors are also encouraged, though not required, to prepare and display posters complementing their talks throughout the workshop, providing workshop participants with the opportunity to engage with their work in a dynamic and flexible format.
