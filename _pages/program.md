Manish Parashar is Director of the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and Presidential Professor in the University of Utah’s Kahlert School of Computing. He recently completed an IPA term as Office Director of NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure, where he oversaw investments in national cyberinfrastructure. He also served as co-chair of the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on the Future Advanced Computing Ecosystem and the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force. Manish is a fellow of AAAS, ACM, and IEEE.

Manish’s research interests are in the broad areas of Parallel and Distributed Computing and Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering. Not only has he published extensively in these areas, but he has also deployed software systems that are in wide use today. Manish is the founding chair of the IEEE Technical Consortium on High Performance Computing (TCHPC) and serves on the editorial boards and organizing committees of a number of journals and international conferences and workshops. 

He has received several awards for his research and leadership, including the 2023 Achievement Award in High Performance Distributed Computing and the 2023 Sidney Fernbach Memorial Award. He is a Fellow of AAAS, ACM, and IEEE.
