### Co-located with IPDPS 2024, 27th May 2024, San Francisco, USA.

From applications to hardware platforms, Edge computing is rapidly transforming the computing landscape. Based on the program and participation in the past years, and particularly drawing on the detailed feedback from in-person workshop attendees in 2023, PAISE 2024 will balance interaction-focused sessions and traditional technical talks. The objective is to enable organic discussions that augment traditional paper presentations, providing a critically needed opportunity to discuss the current trends and issues, to share visions and opinions, to collect feedback and to discuss solutions covering the following areas of edge computing:

* applications &mdash; computer vision, machine learning, analytics, IoT;

* data flows &mdash; processing pipeline of data from ingestion to archival, pipeline of AI from learning to inference;

* control flows &mdash; parallel and distributed programming models and runtimes for managing constrained resources, cybersecurity; and

* infrastructure &mdash; storage, compute, and connectivity conducive to resource-constrained and harsh edge environments.
